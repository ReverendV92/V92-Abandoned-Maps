Name Room

What better proof that you are the author of some stolen models than a room with your name plastered all over the fucking walls?

I posted a bunch of my WIP Halo content to the Halo WAYWO thread on Facepunch in January 2013.

Some random guy took not only mine, but everyone else in the thread's work over to the HaloMaps forums an claimed it was his.

Needless to say that didn't go well for him.

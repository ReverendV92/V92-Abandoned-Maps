FS_Halo_Reach

This one I might actually revisit.

I always found the ecology of the planet Reach to be beautiful (at least pre-invasion) and I thought that seeing as it was essentially the lynchpin of the UNSC, it would make a great map.

If Earth was the civilian homeworld, Reach was the military headquarters.
